Predictive factors for interagency partnership success

The repository contains different items:
1) A polished dataset with 750+ factors that affect success or failure of partnerships between multilateral agencies, associated to their bibliographic source and classified by criticality (L1). 
2) Python code to cluster and visualize the dataset.
3) Different 2D and 3D diagrams, visualizing the dataset and helping its interpretation, and diagrams for the determination of the similarity ratio, and of the keywords by relevant literature author.
